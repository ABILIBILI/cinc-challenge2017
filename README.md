# Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017
### Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Classification from a short single lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) recording

This repository contains the solution to the CinC Challenge 2017 by [1], presented at the Computing in Cardiology conference 2017. As part of the Challenge, based on short single-lead ECG segments with 10-60 seconds duration, the classifier should output one of the following classes:

| Class  | Description |
| ----- | -------------------:|
| N | normal sinus rhythm |
| A | atrial fibrillation (AF) |
| O | other cardiac rhythms |
| ~ | noise segment |


Two methodologies are proposed and are available on distict forlder in this repo:

* Classic feature-based MATLAB approach (`featurebased-approach` folder)
* Deep Convolutional Network Approach in Python (`deeplearn-approach` folder)


Here follows quickstart information about each approach.


Feature-based Approach (MATLAB)
---

This approach makes use of several previously described heart rate variability metrics, morphological features and signal quality indices. After extracting features, two classifiers are trained,namely, an ensemble of bagged trees (50 trees) and multilayer perceptron (2-layer, 10 hidden neurons, feed-forward).

## Dependencies

This code was tested on Matlab R2017a (Version 9.2). 

WFDB Toolbox for Matlab/Octave


Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Approach (Python)
---

Residual Networks (ResNet) [3] are an architecture of CNNs that have produced excelent results in computer vision. Recently, Rajpurkar _et al._ [4] applied a 34-layer ResNet (very similar to the one proposed by [3]) to classify 30-s single lead ECGs segments into 14 different classes. This network is reproduced in this work, implemented using Keras framework with Tensorflow as backend.

### Docker

To facilitate the reproduction of our network, a Docker [(what is Docker?)](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) image of the system architecture for running this code is made available under https://hub.docker.com/r/andreotti/challenge2017/ . The image was generated for CPU and GPUs machine, just modify `<system_architecture>` to `cpu` or `gpu` accordingly.

To pull the Docker image use:

    docker pull andreotti/challenge2017:<system_architecture>
      
To run this image using Jupyter notebook, use:

**CPU Version**
```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -v /sharedfolder:/sharedfolder andreotti/challenge2017:cpu
```
	
**GPU Version**
```bash
nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -v /sharedfolder:/sharedfolder andreotti/challenge2017:gpu
```



The following packages were used:
