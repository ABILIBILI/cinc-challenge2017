# Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017
### Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Classification from a short single lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) recording

This repository contains the solution to the CinC Challenge 2017 by [1], presented at the Computing in Cardiology conference 2017. As part of the Challenge, based on short single-lead ECG segments with 10-60 seconds duration, the classifier should output one of the following classes:

| Class  | Description |
| ----- | -------------------:|
| N | normal sinus rhythm |
| A | atrial fibrillation (AF) |
| O | other cardiac rhythms |
| ~ | noise segment |


Two methodologies are proposed and are available on distict forlder in this repo:

* Classic feature-based MATLAB approach (`featurebased-approach` folder)
* Deep Convolutional Network Approach in Python (`deeplearn-approach` folder)


Here is a quick information about each approach.
