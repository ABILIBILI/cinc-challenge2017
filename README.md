# Approaches used on Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Classification from a short single lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) recording
----

This repository aims at classifying short single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) segments. This work was presented at the Computing in Cardiology conference 2017, as part of the Physionet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 [(Clifford et al 2017)][2]





| Class  | Description |
| ----- | -------------------:|
| N | normal sinus rhythm |
| A | atrial fibrillation (AF) |
| O | other cardiac rhythms |
| ~ | noise segment |



Two methodologies are available:

* Feature-based MATLAB approach
* Deep Convolutional Network Approach in Python

### Feature-based Approach (MATLAB)

#### Dependencies


### Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Approach (Python)



#### Dependencies
**Docker**
